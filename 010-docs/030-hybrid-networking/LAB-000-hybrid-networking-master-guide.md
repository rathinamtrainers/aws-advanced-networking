## Lab Environment Setup

### Shared Infrastructure
Many labs build upon common infrastructure. Consider maintaining:

- **Base VPC**: `Lab-Base-VPC` (10.0.0.0/16)
- **Simulation VPC**: `OnPrem-Simulation-VPC` (192.168.0.0/16)
- **Test Instances**: Consistent across labs for testing
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards for all services

### Naming Conventions
Use consistent naming across labs:
- Resources: `Lab-[Service]-[Component]`
- Security Groups: `[Service]-[Purpose]-SG`
- Route Tables: `[Service]-[Purpose]-RT`
- Subnets: `[Service]-[Purpose]-Subnet-[AZ]`

### Cost Management
- Use smallest instance types (t3.micro/t3.small)
- Stop instances between lab sessions
- Clean up resources after each lab
- Monitor billing alerts

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Lab Combinations
Some labs work well together for advanced scenarios:

1. **Enterprise Hybrid**: Labs 12 + 15 + 20 + 22
   - Complete enterprise connectivity
   - Multiple connection types
   - Central routing hub
   - Unified DNS

2. **Global Architecture**: Labs 20 + 21 + 24
   - Multi-region connectivity
   - Performance optimization
   - Global network management

3. **Security Focus**: Labs 13 + 22 + 23

   - DNS security
   - Private service connectivity

### Real-World Scenarios
Apply lab concepts to realistic scenarios:

- **Migration Project**: Use Direct Connect + VPN for phased migration
- **DR Architecture**: Implement cross-region failover
- **Compliance Requirements**: Secure connectivity for regulated workloads
- **Performance Optimization**: Global content delivery

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues Across Labs

#### Connectivity Problems
1. **Security Group Rules**
   - Always check source/destination rules
   - Remember separate rules for TCP and UDP
   - ICMP for ping testing

2. **Route Table Configuration**
   - Verify most specific routes take precedence
   - Check route propagation settings
   - Validate target associations

3. **BGP Issues**
   - Confirm ASN configuration
   - Check BGP authentication
   - Monitor session establishment

#### AWS Service Limits
- VPC limits (5 per region default)
- Transit Gateway attachments (5000 per TGW)
- VPN connections (50 per region)
- Direct Connect virtual interfaces (50 per connection)

#### Performance Issues
- MTU size considerations (1500 vs 9000 bytes)
- BGP path selection algorithms
- Network latency and jitter
- Bandwidth limitations

### Diagnostic Tools
Use these tools for troubleshooting:

1. **AWS Console**
   - VPC Reachability Analyzer
   - VPC Flow Logs
   - CloudWatch metrics

2. **Command Line**
   ```bash
   # Network testing
   ping -c 4 target-ip
   traceroute target-ip
   dig domain-name
   
   # AWS CLI
   aws ec2 describe-route-tables
   aws directconnect describe-connections
   aws ec2 describe-vpn-connections
   ```

3. **Third-Party Tools**
